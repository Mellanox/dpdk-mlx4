.. title:: Mellanox ConnectX-3 DPDK poll-mode driver

About the Mellanox ConnectX-3 DPDK poll-mode driver
===================================================

DPDK PMD for Mellanox ConnectX-3 Ethernet adapters.

This driver is based on *libibverbs* and currently supports:

- Scattering/gathering RX/TX packets
- Multiple RX (with RSS/RCA) and TX queues
- Multiple MAC addresses
- VLAN filtering
- Link state information
- Software counters/statistics
- Start/stop/close operations
- Multiple physical ports host adapter
- DPDK 1.6.0 or above from `dpdk.org <http://www.dpdk.org/>`_.

Known limitations
-----------------

- Multiple RX VLAN filters can be configured, but only the first one works
  properly.
- RSS hash key and options cannot be modified.
- Hardware counters are not implemented.
- Number of configured RSS queues must be a power of 2.

Requirements
------------

Linux host with either a full installation of Mellanox OFED 2.3 (updated
kernel drivers and libraries), or only the following components:

- Mellanox OFA kernel drivers (*mlnx-ofa_kernel*)
- Generic verbs library and headers (*libibverbs*)
- Mellanox ConnectX InfiniBand library (*libmlx4*)

Note that the **mlx4_core.ko** kernel module must be loaded first and requires
the **log_num_mgm_entry_size=-1** parameter (now enabled by default),
otherwise the PMD won't work properly.

*libibverbs* is assumed to be installed in a standard system location and
should be found without specific linker flags (such as *-L*). The same
applies to its headers location (*-I*).

Other requirements:

- A supported DPDK version
- An up-to-date GCC-based toolchain

Usage
=====

Provided all software components have been successfully installed and at least
one ConnectX adapter is present in the host system, *testpmd* can be used to
test it.

The following examples show a machine hosting two dual-port adapters (4 ports
total), linked together at 40Gbps by a crossover cable.

Make sure that kernel modules **mlx4_core**, **mlx4_en**, **mlx4_ib** and
**ib_uverbs** are loaded::

 root# modprobe -a mlx4_core mlx4_en mlx4_ib ib_uverbs

Packets cannot be emitted or received if physical interfaces are not in the
"up" state. By default, loading **mlx4_core** does it automatically.

However, once **mlx4_en** is loaded, system management scripts may bring them
down afterwards. The following command forces them in the "up" state::

 root# for i in `echo /sys/class/net/*/device/infiniband_verbs/uverbs* | \
  sed -rn 's,/([^/]+/){3}([^/]+)[^ ]*,\2,g;p'`; do echo ip link set $i up; done

Run *testpmd* interactively from the DPDK build tree (for more information
about command-line options, see the corresponding documentation)::

- Start IO forwarding between ports 1 and 3. The *tx_first* argument tells
  *testpmd* to send a single packet burst which will be forwarded forever by
  both ports::

Compilation
===========

This driver is normally compiled independently as a shared object. The DPDK
source tree is only required for its headers, no patches required.

Once DPDK is compiled, *librte_pmd_mlx4* can be unpacked elsewhere and
compiled::

 root# make clean
 rm -f librte_pmd_mlx4.so mlx4.o config.h
 root# make RTE_TARGET=x86_64-default-linuxapp-gcc RTE_SDK=~/DPDK
 rm -f config.h
 Looking for IBV_EXP_DEVICE_UD_RSS enum in infiniband/verbs.h. Defining RSS_SUPPORT.
 Looking for struct ibv_send_wr_raw type in infiniband/verbs.h. Defining SEND_RAW_WR_SUPPORT.
 Looking for struct rte_pktmbuf type in rte_mbuf.h. Defining HAVE_STRUCT_RTE_PKTMBUF.
 Looking for mtu_get_t type in rte_ethdev.h. Not defining HAVE_MTU_GET.
 Looking for mtu_set_t type in rte_ethdev.h. Defining HAVE_MTU_SET.
 Looking for struct rte_eth_fc_conf.autoneg field in rte_ethdev.h. Defining HAVE_FC_CONF_AUTONEG.
 Looking for struct eth_dev_ops.flow_ctrl_get field in rte_ethdev.h. Defining HAVE_FLOW_CTRL_GET.

The following macros can be overridden on the command-line:

   RTE_SDK
      DPDK source tree location (mandatory).
   RTE_TARGET
      DPDK output directory for generated files (default: *build*).
   DEBUG
      If *1*, enable driver debugging.
   MLX4_PMD_SGE_WR_N
      Change the maximum number of scatter/gather elements per work
      request. The minimum value is 1, which disables support for segmented
      packets and jumbo frames with a size greater than a single segment for
      both TX and RX. Default: *4*).
